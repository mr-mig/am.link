The helper function which links the state objects and propagate change between them using the transformer function.

All method calls can be chained.
There can be several source and target states:
```javascript
link($scope)
  .from(state1, 'field1')
  .from(state2, 'field2')
  .to(targetState, 'field3')
  .with(function(newValue){
    return newValue + 'some demo stuff';
  });
```


## link(scope)

Create a link using the current scope

## link.from(sourceState, sourceField)

Create a link from the given `sourceState.sourceField` value.
This value will be observed and a change will be triggered if the value changes.

## link.from(sourceState)

Create a link from the given `sourceState` object.
The object will be **deep watched**.
The change will be triggered if any field of the object changes.


## link.from(sourceState, method)

Create a link from the given `sourceState.method` method.
The change will be triggered when **the method is called**.


## link.to(targetState, targetField)

Links the `targetState.targetField` as a target state.
When the change is triggered from the source state, the target state will be modified using transformer function.

## link.with(fn)

Assign the **transform function** to the current link.
Transform function has a signature `sourceState.sourceField -> targetState.targetField`.

When the change is triggered the function will overwrite `targetState.targetField` with a new value.
